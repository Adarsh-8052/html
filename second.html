        <p> Moments after the T20 World Cup win last Saturday in Barbados.
            <br> where India beat South Africa by seven runs to lift the coveted trophy for the second time in history
             <br> three members of the squad announced their retirement from T20I cricket within the next 24 hours.
              <br> Virat Kohli was the first, announcing it right after he collected the Player of the Match award.
              <br> India captain Rohit Sharma followed suit, making the announcement in the post-match press conference.
              <br> And finally, a few hours later, Ravindra Jadeja joined the bandwagon.
              <br> But is Jasprit Bumrah next on the list?
